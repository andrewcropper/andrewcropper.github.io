    <p>I’m a PhD student at Imperial College London, supervised by <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/shm/" target="_blank">Stephen Muggleton</a>. I work on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Specifically, I work on inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning that uses logic programming as a uniform representation for background knowledge, examples, and induced theories. More specifically, I work on a form of ILP named meta-interpretive learning, which is based on a Prolog meta-interpreter and uses higher-order metarules to support predicate invention, object invention, and learning of recursive theories.

    Before this, I spent a summer at the University of Cambridge working on distributed graph algorithms. 

    </p>

    Before that, I worked as a research engineer at MFG Labs, a small startup based in Paris, France. At MFG Labs I generally worked on large-scale information retrieval problems, namely entity resolution. 

</p>

    Before that, I studied for a master’s degree at the University of Oxford, where I focused on information retrieval, computational linguistics, and machine learning. My MSc thesis investigated whether Twitter activity could predict stock volume.

    Before that, I studied for an batcher’s degree at Nottingham Trent University. My undergraduate dissertation investigated an approach to identifying and inferring objects from textual descriptions of scenes from a book.
