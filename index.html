    I’m a PhD student at Imperial College London, supervised by <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/shm/" target="_blank">Professor Stephen Muggleton</a>. 

    I work on machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

    Specifically, I work on inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning that uses logic programming as a uniform representation for background knowledge, examples, and induced theories. 

    More specifically, I work on a form of ILP named meta-interpretive learning, which is based on a Prolog meta-interpreter and uses higher-order metarules to support predicate invention, object invention, and the learning of recursive theories. 

    For my PhD thesis, I am trying to learn efficient logic programs which are optimal with respect to some objective function.

    Before starting my PhD, I worked on distributed graph algorithms at the University of Cambridge.

    Before that, I worked as a research engineer at MFG Labs, a startup based in Paris, France, where I worked on large-scale information retrieval problems. 

    Before that, I studied for a master’s degree at the University of Oxford. My MSc thesis investigated whether Twitter activity could predict stock volume. 

    Before that, I studied for an batcher’s degree at Nottingham Trent University. My undergraduate dissertation investigated identifying and inferring objects from textual descriptions of scenes from a book.
